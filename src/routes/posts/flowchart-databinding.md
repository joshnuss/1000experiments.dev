The other day I [put together a flowchart](/posts/new-product-app-idea) for the process of creating a new e-commerce product. It got me thinking about workflows (aka flowcharts) and whether they can be built dynamically.

With a dynamic flow, assigning tasks, completing tasks and reviewing them can be organized visually in a decision tree. The tree could be colored to show which parts were completed and linked to related assets.

I still need to figure out how to do better positioning of the elements, but it's a start.
