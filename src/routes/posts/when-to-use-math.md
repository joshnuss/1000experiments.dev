When I was taught math, the focus was mostly on the "how":

- **How** to multiply numbers.
- **How** to work with fractions.
- **How** to use calculus.
- etc..

But even more useful is to know the **when**:

- **When** to multiply numbers.
- **When** to work with fractions.
- **When** to use calculus.
- etc..

Especially nowadays, where computers can solve so many mathematical problemsfor us, knowing "when" is even more important because it allows us to navigate through many possible solutions and locate the resources to teach us "how".

You could say that knowing "how" is a lot like knowing how to use a hammer. Sure it's nice to know how to bang in a nail without jamming your thumbs, but not all situations require a hammer. To select the best tool for the job, we need to know "when" each tool should (or shouldn't) be used.

## Math catalog

So I thought it would be a useful to catalog some math concepts with a short definition of when you should use it.

It's basically just me running a bunch of Google searches for "when should I use X", and noting them here.

### Addition

Joining multiple items together.

### Subtraction

Removing items from a set.

### Multiplication

Repeating a set of items.

### Division

Breaking a set of items into parts.

### Fractions

Working with quantity that can be less than a single unit.

### Exponents

Abbreviating large numbers.

### Equation & Formulas

Describing how multiple variables relate to each other.

### Geometry

Visualizing math with drawings.

### Logarithms

Scaling numbers.

### Linear algebra

Working with sets of equations.

### Logic

A language for reasoning.

### Combinatorics

Finding all possible outcomes.

### Number theory

Discovering relationships between numbers.

### Calculus

Finding aproximate solutions to equations.

### Statistics

Gathering, reviewing, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data.

### Machine learning
