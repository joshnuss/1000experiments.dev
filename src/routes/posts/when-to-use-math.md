When I was taught math, the focus was mostly on the "how":

- **How** to multiply numbers.
- **How** to work with fractions.
- **How** to use calculus.
- etc..

They were obsessed with teaching us the techniques, rather than the **why** and the **when**.

Nowadays, where computers can solve so many mathematical problems, knowing "why" and "when" are even more important. They allow navigate to the solution and the find resources to teach us "how".

Knowing "how" is like knowing how to use a hammer. It's helpful, but not all situations require a hammer. To select the best tool for the job, we need to know "why" and "when" each tool should (or shouldn't) be used.

## Math catalog

So I thought it would be a useful to catalog some math concepts with a short definition of when you should use it.

It's basically just me running a bunch of Google searches for "when should I use X", and noting them here.

### Addition

Joining multiple items together.

### Subtraction

Removing items from a set.

### Multiplication

Repeating a set of items.

### Division

Breaking a set of items into parts.

### Fractions

Working with quantity that can be less than a single unit.

### Exponents

Abbreviating large numbers.

### Equation & Formulas

Describing how multiple variables relate to each other.

### Geometry

Visualize math with drawings.

### Logarithms

Scaling numbers.

### Linear algebra

Working with sets of equations.

### Logic

A language for reasoning.

### Combinatorics

Finding all possible outcomes.

### Number theory

Discovering relationships between numbers.

### Calculus

Finding aproximate solutions to equations.

### Statistics

Gathering, reviewing, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data.

## Machine learning

Extracting algorithms from data.
