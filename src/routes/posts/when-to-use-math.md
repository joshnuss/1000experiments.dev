When I was taught math, they always seemed to focus on the "how". How to multiple numbers. How to use calculus. The focus was always on techniques, rather than the "why" and the "when".

Especially in this day and age, where computers can solve so many mathematical problems, it feels like "why" and "when" are even more important. If we know why&when we can always navigate to the solution or find resources that teach "how". But if we only know "how", were like a baker than only knows one way to bake bread, we're kind of blind to what's possible.

So I thought it would be a usefil to list some different math concepts and a short definition of when you should use them.

It's basically just me running a bunch of google searches for "when should I use \<term\>" and noting them here.

## Addition

Joining multiple items together.

## Subtraction

Removing items from a set.

## Multiplication

Repeating a set of items.

## Division

Breaking a set of items into equal parts.

## Fraction

When the quantity is less than a single unit. eg. slice of pizza vs a bite of pizza, if a slice is a single unit, then a bite is a fraction of a slice.

## Exponents

Abbreviate large numbers.

## Equation & Formulas

Describe how multiple variables relate to each other. 

## Geometry

Visualize math with drawings.

## Logarithms

Scale numbers.

## Linear algebra

Working with sets of equations.

## Logic

A language for reasoning.

## Combinatorics

Find all possible outcomes.

## Number theory

Discover relationships between numbers.

## Calculus

Find aproximate solutions to equations.

## Statistics

Gather, review, analyze, and draw conclusions from data.
