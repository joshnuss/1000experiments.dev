When I was taught math, the focus was mostly on the "how":

**How** to multiply numbers.
**How** to work with fractions.
**How** to use calculus.

They were obsessed with teaching us the techniques, rather than the "why" and the "when".

Nowadays, where computers can solve so many mathematical problems, it feels like knowing "why" and "when" are even more important. When we know "why" & "when" we can always navigate to the solution or find resources that teach the "how".

Knowing "how" is like knowing how to use a hammer. It's helpful, but not all situations require a hammer. To select the best tool for the job, we need to know "why" and "when" each tool should be used.

So I thought it would be a usefil to catalog some different math concepts and a short definition of when you should use them.

It's basically just me running a bunch of google searches for "when should I use X", and noting them here.

## Addition

Joining multiple items together.

## Subtraction

Removing items from a set.

## Multiplication

Repeating a set of items.

## Division

Breaking a set of items into parts.

## Fractions

When the quantity is less than a single unit. eg. slice of pizza vs. a bite of pizza. If a slice is a single unit, then a bite is a fraction of a slice.

## Exponents

Abbreviating large numbers.

## Equation & Formulas

Describing how multiple variables relate to each other.

## Geometry

Visualize math with drawings.

## Logarithms

Scaling numbers.

## Linear algebra

Working with sets of equations.

## Logic

A language for reasoning.

## Combinatorics

Finding all possible outcomes.

## Number theory

Discovering relationships between numbers.

## Calculus

Finding aproximate solutions to equations.

## Statistics

Gathering, reviewing, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data.
