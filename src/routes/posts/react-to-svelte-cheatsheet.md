For my upcoming course at [newline.co](https://www.newline.co/courses/svelte-for-react-devs), I need a small but helpful piece of content that could be used as a freebie or lead magnet.

So I put together a "React to Svelte cheatsheet" in Figma.

## Demo

I'm deliberately not sharing the image/pdf because I don't know how I'll use it yet.

## Notes

- Needs more design touchups.
- Needs some more content, like bundle size, and maybe animation, transitions and actions or that could be a separate cheat sheet.
