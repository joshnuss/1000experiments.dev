Today I made some updates to the landing page template. It's coming a long quite nicely, gonna be really cool.

I did get stuck with rendering the code animation thing server-side. The `codemirror` library is designed to render in the browser only. I'm just not familiar with dynamic importing. So I'll look at it again tomorrow.
