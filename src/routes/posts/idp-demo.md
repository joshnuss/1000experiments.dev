> "If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late" - Reid Hoffman

Figured I would try to get some feedback early. So I put together a demo video and sent it to a few people.

I hope it helps me find holes and objections, so I can adjust the idea accordingly.

## Demo

Here's an early demo:

<video controls src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dzwnkx0mk/video/upload/v1655177301/1000experiments.dev/idp-demo-rendered_vc5ilr.mp4"/>

## Notes

- Refine demo based on feedback
