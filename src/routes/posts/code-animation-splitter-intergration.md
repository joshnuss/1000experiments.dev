This is an integration of the [last experiment](/posts/layout-resize), see video below.

It also persists the dimensions of the panes to `localStorage`.

## Code

https://gitpod.io#snapshot/470eea3a-195d-4471-968d-f9cd6347eb08

## Demo

<video controls src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dzwnkx0mk/video/upload/v1618813753/1000experiments.dev/splitters_tskgxi.mp4"/>

## Notes

- What happens if they re-open the browser on a screen with different dimensions, should it still use the settings from local storage?
