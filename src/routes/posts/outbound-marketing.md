I contacted 5 people about my current projects.

Traditionally, this is where I'm not great, so I really think it works well to think of it as an experiment. I wanna get better at speaking with other people about what I'm working on. The challenges people have are the fuel that feeds the projects. Also, it's nice to catch up with folks.

So I may try this one multiple times. At least a couple of times a week. That's another thing to think about: recurring experiments.
