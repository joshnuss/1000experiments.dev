Have you ever tried to find a book in the bookstore? It can be a pain.

But what if the location of every book was stored in the computer and updated in realtime? Then we can use Augmented Reality (AR) software to overlay a map that displays where the item is.

And it's not just books. The same idea would work for grocery stores, clothing stores, or warehouses. Anything that deals with storage could benefit from digital mapping techonlogy.

Since I got a new phone that support AR, figured I'd try to use this idea to learn more about it.
