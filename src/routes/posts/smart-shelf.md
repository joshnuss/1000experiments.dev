Have you ever tried to find a book in the bookstore?
It can be a bit of a pain.

But what if the location of every book was stored in the computer and updated in realtime? Then we could use Augmented Reality (AR) to overlay a map that displays where the item is. All we'd need to do is to pull out our phone and it would pinpoint the location.

And it's not just for books. The same idea would work for grocery stores, clothing stores, or warehouses. Anything that deals with storage could benefit from digital mapping techonlogy.

Since I got a new phone that support AR, figured I'd try to use this idea to learn more about AR and see if this is possible to build.
