Today I did a test for the code-animation tool.

I put together an example animation to see if it can help others.

I'm trying to move towards a model where I build things with real users in mind. Historically, I'm a lot heavier on building things than on verifying. I typically build a bunch and then verify much later. I would like to move towards a tighter loop, or at least experiment with it a bit.
