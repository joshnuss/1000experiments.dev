Following up on [the experiment with infinite tick marks](/posts/infinite-tick-marks), I want to add scaling.

It occurred to me that D3 has libraries for this, so in this experiement I look into using D3 to scale and draw the tick marks.

It's my first time using D3, so It took a lot of reading example code to figure it out, but it's a pretty impressive library.

## Code

## Notes

- There should be two types of tick marks, some with labels and some without.
