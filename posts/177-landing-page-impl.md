Started implementing the landing page for the code animation site. I would like to start getting an e-mail list together, or some idea of interest.

It's OK if I'm totally way off. If so, it would be good to know and then I'll move on to something else.

My plan is to launch the landing page in conjunction with an article on dev.to that shows how to animate Codemirror, my selling element will be "if you don't want to roll you own, I'm building a point-and-click solution here..."and then they see the CTA to get beta access.

I decided, I will do a free plan with a watermark on the videos, and a paid plan to remove/customize the watermark.
