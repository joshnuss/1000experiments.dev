I was using Svelte's REPL for most of the project, but as the number of components grow, it's probably a better idea to share it in a different way.

Was reading today that GitPod [migrated their site to svelte-kit](https://github.com/gitpod-io/website-kumquat), and they have [svelte-kit integration](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/sveltekit-example).

## GitPod

So I migrated the project over, you can view it here:
