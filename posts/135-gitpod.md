I was using Svelte's REPL for most of the project, but as the number of components grow, it's probably a better idea to share it in a different way.

Was reading today that GitPod [migrated their site to svelte-kit](https://github.com/gitpod-io/website-kumquat), figured it's a good time to try it out. So I migrated the project over.
