Yesterday I watched a video on YC's YouTube channel [about Weebly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LNQxT9LvM0&ab_channel=YCombinator), and the CEO told a story about how he heard about YC just a few hours before the submission window was closing.

Today - at 10pm to be exact, I realized that YC's submission deadline was at 11pm EST. So I rushed to put out an application for [CarrierWave](https://getcarrierwave.com).

No big expectations, this is just another experiment.
