Last year, I set out to create 12 startups in 12 months. After the first month, I launched the [first idea](https://producthunt.com/posts/requr) and began thinking about the next one. As I considered my options, the tires started spinning. I wanted to find a good idea, something that had a shot at working. Though I did eventually select and publish [second idea](http://producthunt.com/posts/carrierwave), I wondered if this format of 12 ideas in 12 months is ideal for me.

## Chasing certainty

Last summer, I read Annie Duke's book [Thinking in Bets](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Bets-Making-Smarter-Decisions-ebook/dp/B074DG9LQF) and it made me think a lot about the the dangers of outcome bias. For example, if a startup is successful, we assume everything they did is correct. But that's a cognitive bias. It's possible they did everything wrong, yet persevered through sheer luck. It's also possible that if they did things differently, they'd be even more successful.

But I do like the recurring element of the 12 startups in 12 months plan, I do beleive that doing reps are a great way to improve.

I think the problem I ran into was that wanting some assurance of success before I commit to an idea.

It made me question the value of certainty, and whether chasing it helps at all. As you know, we humans can't see into the future, yet we must make decisions about how we spend our time, where to put our effort. So we must project into the future, but the outcome is projecting too far.

Even if an idea does succeed, there's so much luck involved (aka external uncontrolled forces) that you can't truly say that you successfully predicted the outcome. We can't design outcomes, we can only try things, the future is unpredictable.

## Ignoring outcomes

I feel like the only sane thing to do is experiment. Experimenting means ignoring the result, successful or not, it doesn't matter at the outset. In fact - a unsuccessful result is extremely useful too, because it becomes fuel for the next idea, so you really can't lose.

Fast forward to a few months ago: I started to make it a point to do 3 daily experiments. Usually, less than 30 minutes each.

Why three per day? Because 3 * 365 days means 1095 experiments per year. or roughly 1000 if I miss a day here or there. It's been super fun so far. I've found some interesting ideas.

Recently I felt the neeed to catalog the experiments so I can review them at the end of the month and see if there are any patterns. I figured, why not just do it in public? (Hat tip to [@swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx) for pushing "Learning in public")

Can't promise this turns into anything.

But, let's see what happens?
