Last summer, I read Annie Duke's book [Thinking in Bets](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Bets-Making-Smarter-Decisions-ebook/dp/B074DG9LQF) and it made me think a lot about the the dangers of focusing about outcome.

## Certainty

A few months before that, I had set out to spend a year creating 12 startups in 12 months. After the first month, I launched the [first idea](https://producthunt.com/posts/requr) and began moving on to the next one. As I tried to decide what the next idea should be, my tires started spinning. I wanted a good idea, an idea that had a shot at working. Basically what I wanted some certainty of success before I put more work in.

It made me think a lot about certainty, and wether chasing it helps at all. As you know, us humans, we can't see the future, yet we must make decisions about how we spend our time, where to put our effort. Planning and deciding feels like an attempt to predict the future. The future is not something we are not in control of.

And even if your idea does succeed, there's so much luck involved (aka external uncrotrolled forces) that you can't truly say that you successfully predicted the outcome.

## Ignoring outcomes

So I feel like the only sane thing is to experiment, to ignore wether the result is successful or not. In fact - a unsuccessful result is fuel for the nxt idea, so I welcome them.

A few months ago I started to make it a point to do 3 experiments per day. Why three? Because 3 * 365 days means 1095 experiments per year. or ~1000 if I miss a couple days.

I can't promise this turns into anything, my only aim is to do 3 experiments per day and publish them here.

So let's see what happens?
