They say that for every day you code, you should spend 4 days marketing. I've never come anywhere close that. Doubt if I even do 5%, definitely never 400%.

But I'm going to spend more experiments on marketing because it's an area I want to improve in.

So following up on the last experiment, where [I thought about my distribution options](/posts/delivery-estimates-11), figured I should spec out a plan for each marketing angle:

## Content marketing

A few blog post ideas:

- How to increase sales with urgency
- How to reduce e-commerce customer service requests
- Why urgency works for selling e-commerce

## Join ventures

- Find 5 bloggers
- Find 5 podcasters
- Find 5 newletters

Provide 25% to advertise

## Freemium

- Creating a free starter version with some limitations
  - number of orders
  - free trial

## Outbound

Find 10 companies you can reach out to

## Ads

- Setup 3 different ads and test them on Reddit /r/ecommerce, FB, and LinkedIn
- Look into ads on e-commerce newsletters

## Seek advisement

Make a list of 5 people.
