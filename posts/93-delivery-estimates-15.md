Continuing with the [map I built in the previous experiment](/posts/delivery-estimates-14), I added an overlay on each country to show how long delivery would take.

Unfourtunately, I lost the code when I refereshed the REPL. ;(

It's the 3rd time this happened me in the past few weeks. Tomorrow, I'm going to open a PR to fix it by raise a warning when navigating away with unsaved changes.
