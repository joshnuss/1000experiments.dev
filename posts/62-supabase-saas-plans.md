Did some more work on creating a saas template for supabase. I'm using svelte-kit, which is quite new, so there's lots to figure out.

I made the hairbrained mistake of swapping the parameters to supabase's `createClient()`, and then had to do a bunch of debugging before figuring out what I did. Oh well.. at least I learned more about debugging vite and svelte-kit.

It's looking really nice though, I copied the plan section from the sales page for the Refactoring UI book. Pretty shmick.
