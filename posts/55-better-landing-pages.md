Been thinking about what makes a good landing page. I haven't had a successful one yet, but I know some things that don't work:

1. Putting out a landing page on it's own does nothing. People need to come to it.
2. Expecting people to signup to a beta list for vaporware doesn't work. There must already be some value or return.
3. Just having a signup form. People need a reason to sign up. ie something compelling like an offer, freebie or discount.
4. Not being up front about the price. Better to mention what the price will be. That way you know they aren't signing up hoping for a free thing.
5. Not having referrals or social proof.

## Landing Page Questionaire

Put together a list of questions I can use for landing pages.

- Who is the **target audience**?
> People that sell to developers.

- What **problem** are you solving?
> Marketing to developers

- How **expensive** is the problem?

> It's definitely a problem. With marketing it's hard to quantify an exact amount. Could be a lot.

- How will people **locate** it? ideally 5 channels:

> Twitter, ProductHunt, IndieHackers, Reddit

- What **offer** do people get for signing up?

> 25% off

- What is the **initial price**? mention it near the signup button.

> $10/month

- What is the **headline**? Put pressure on the pain point or point out key result

> Turn code into marketing

- What is the **sub-heading**? bold, italize and color key words

> Developers are tired of reading code. Make sure you're getting noticed.

- Are there **compelling visuals** in the hero section? The landing page should have a demo, screenshots of the product and video

> Yes. I will use an animation of some code

- What are the **major selling points**? These become the feature bullets.

> Demos: Add eye-catching demos to your marketing pages.
> Docs: Add interactivity to your docs and blog posts.
> Sharing: Generate GIFs and .mp4 files you can use on social media.
> Annotations: add captions to the animation
