Decided to try to integrate some previous experiments together and create a short animation.

I used Supabase's `signIn` API for the example (see below).

I'm curious to see if animations like this get more engagement [on social media](https://twitter.com/joshnuss/status/1370235224521588736). I wonder if it's better positioned as a marketing tool for folks selling to developers or if it's better positioned as an education tool, ie. as a sidebar accompanying docs or blog posts.

More marketing experiments to come.
