Continuing with animated code editor. I added the typewriter effect for adding code. Probably should use typewriting for deleting as well, so it look s like the backspace key.

The nice thing, I was able to highlight green while typing. I think it's gonna be a big aid to see the areas changing highlighted in green/red etc, compared to live coding, where it's hard to see the cursor

Here's the code:
