In Seth Godin's book "Permission Marketing", he makes it clear that being pushy with marketing doesn't work. In fact, giving the user more choice, increases trust.

So I wondered, what if newsletter signup forms asked the user to choose the e-mail frequency.

If the user chooses "monthly", then all outgoing emails would be queued on the senders side, and sent out as one batch "recap" style email.
