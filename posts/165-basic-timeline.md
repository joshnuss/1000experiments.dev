Now comes the fun part where I get to integrate a bunch of experiments together.

This one is an integration of these 4 experiments:

- [#30 Timeline editor view](/posts/timeline-editor)
- [#31 Timeline manual position selection](/posts/timeline-selection)
- [#32 Timeline events](/posts/timeline-events)
- [#125 Timeline duration display](/posts/timeline-duration-display)
