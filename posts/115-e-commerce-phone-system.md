Many e-commerce stores handle support via phone calls. In this experiment, I look at reducing the call volume by adding some inteligence to the phone system, so that it can handle common tasks, like:

- Checking an order's status
- Handling a refund request
- Requesting a callback

The nice thing is your don't need much security if you respond through e-mail. ie, the customer enters their order number, and they get an email with the status. So it avoids privacy issues. (see example below)
