I realized something today. The good thing about the code animation project is that it has the most potential distribution. Since the group I have most connections in are developers, it's a lot easier to get this thing used.

Compare that to e-commerce projects where I don't have a following of store owners, I only know a handful that will take my call. It's a good market, but I don't have strong distribution there.

## Marketing Strategy

From a marketing perspective it's a lot easier to get people to try the code animiation tool. That means getting into the hands of real people, adjusting it to work better for real-life scenarions and getting testimonials. Which are things my previous projects weren't strong on.

I think for this project, it would be better to release it in a limited exclusive way before opening it up to the wider public.

But I am conviced today it is a powerful tool, every time [I use it in a tweet](https://twitter.com/joshnuss/status/1380379869507416064), the tweet gets 10X-20X more engagement. Which is a lot.

## Preparing demos

Continuing with my marketing strategy of helping people instead of selling (aka ["serve don't sell"](https://servedontsell.com/) h/t Liston Witherill), my plan is to prepare example videos (for free) to help people I know. It could help anyone from a book author, course creator, framework builder, marketer at a company that sells to developers. Anyone.

Currrently, preparing those demos needs to be done by hand, like I did for a friend today (see [experiment #116](/posts/code-animation-test)). It takes settings up the animation steps in a JSON file and adjusting the styling to match their brand.

## Multiple timelines

It would be handy to get the timeline working so I don't have to hand code examples. It would also be useful to be able to animate across multiple windows, like a code editor and a browser or a terminal with phone overlay. Each screen would need it's own timeline.

So that brings me to todays experiment: Figuring out how to make multiple timelines work visually:
