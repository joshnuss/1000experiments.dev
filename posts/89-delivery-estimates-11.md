This one is a thought experiment.

The challenge for me as a software developer is distribution. Getting access to the target customer is critical. Ideally I should be talking to them every week.

So what are the things I can try to get that access:

- **Content marketing**: writing blog posts or creating videos about topics the target audience cares about.
- **Joint venture**: contacting podcasts or publications the target market follows, and offering them a percentage.
- **Freemium**: giving it away for free, maybe with some limitations.
- **Ads**: Reddit, Facebook, LinkedIn and/or Instagram ads
- **Outbound**: cold outreach. Not a big fan, but maybe still worth trying.
