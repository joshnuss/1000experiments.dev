Thinking about running some marketing experiments, so I starting building out a landing page template. Working on stubbing out the mobile version first.

Hoping to get to a point when I can generate a new landing page repo and deploy to `vercel` in a couple of bash commands.

Here's the code:

Here's what it looks like so far:
